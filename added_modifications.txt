Following the part 2 of the exercise, meaning the tutorial in the link,

I have added:

- Visuals: Using the 3D models of the project, when a sheep is hitted by a hay bale
a red heart emerges and both 3D objects (the sheep and the heart) dissapears doing a
"tweening" effect on the scale of the objects, all this with the TweenScale script.

- Sound: Using a sound manager, I have added sound to the following events:
	- When a hay bale is shooted
	- When a sheep is hitted by a hay bale
	- When the sheep drops(falls into the abyss)

- Score: Now the game can keep an score of the hitted sheeps and the missed sheeps,
all this using the managers Game State Manager. In order to show the score state, the
User Interface Manager (UIManager) script uses the game data from the GameStateManager
and shows it using sprites to represent the hits and the misses.

-Access to the game scene from the title sceen and the possibility to quit the game
using the start and wuit buttons from the title scene and adding the interaction with the
user using the EventSystem which tracks the mouse state, also adding the color effects
on the buttons when the mouse is over the buttons.
